<h1>The Movies</h1>
<p>
  Pretty much everyone has heard of the insanely popular and successful game Fortnite. It has millions of players all around the globe, from young kids in elementary and middle school, all the way to adults that want to play a fun game. This popularity has led to multiple professional and amateur level tournaments with millions of dollars in prize money earned by people of all ages. But did you know that the game has its origins in a Japanese movie released in the year 2000 called Battle Royale?</p>
  <p>
  The movie Battle Royale, based on a book of the same name by Koushun Takami, takes place in a near future dystopian Japan where an authoritarian regime attempts to control its rebellious youth by selecting a high school class and sending them to an island where they force the students to kill each other until there is only one person left. When the movie was first released, it quickly made an impact in Japan for being very violent. It was rated R-15, meaning that no one under the age of 15 was allowed to see the movie. [11] While there has been a rumor that Battle Royale was officially banned in the United States, this is not true. Anchor Bay Entertainment, the movie’s current American license holder, put out a press release blaming "civic groups" for preventing the film from being shown in the American market. This doesn’t mean that Americans didn’t know about the movie. "I've been seeing [Battle Royale] T-shirts at ComicCon for 10 years," says Anchor Bay executive director of marketing Kevin Carney. "So the wider horror/manga/comic demo is aware of the film. Even if they might not have seen it, they know of it.”[2]</p>

  For those that know of it, there is no denying that there are similarities between Battle Royale and the mega hit The Hunger Games. Many believe that Battle Royale's influence extended to Suzanne Collins, author of the hit book and movie series The Hunger Games, which shares an overlapping plot arc with the movie. However, Collins denies even having heard of Battle Royale before writing The Hunger Games. “When I asked Collins if she had drawn from “Battle Royale,” she was unperturbed. “I had never heard of that book or that author until my book was turned in. At that point, it was mentioned to me, and I asked my editor if I should read it. He said: ‘No, I don’t want that world in your head. Just continue with what you’re doing.’ “She has yet to read the book or to see the movie.”[10]</p>

  The Hunger Games follows Katniss Everdeen, a teenager in the oppressive nation of Panem, as she is drafted to compete in the nation’s annual Hunger Games. This is a game where 24 people are forced to compete and the last person standing is the victor. Katniss threatens to end the game in a draw by committing dual suicide with her perceived love interest who are the only two alive at the end. The game’s producers
  end the game before the two of them ingest the poison leaving the game with 2 victors. The first book was designated as being worthy of two sequels: Catching Fire and Mockingjay.  The three books together were given a four part movie adaptation.</p>

  The Hunger Games books and movies helped introduce the ‘battle royale’ concept to a wider audience. While the actual Hunger Games themselves seem like a very unpleasant thing if you had to live through it, they turned out to be the basis for some pretty interesting and fun games.</p>

  Anchor Bay Entertainment is knowingly capitalizing on the release of The Hunger Games movie. "I enjoyed the [The Hunger Games] novel and genuinely hope the films do well, but it obviously was influenced by Battle Royale," Carney says. "So our release strategy is extremely focused around the anticipation for The Hunger Games. Which means that now that The Hunger Games has brought dystopia to our shores, it's possible that the American cult audience for Battle Royale has only begun forming.” [2]
