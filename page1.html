<p>Thou accursed guts-griping promise-breaker! Thou clouted pox-marked canker-blossom! Thou appeareth nothing to me but a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. Thou clouted pox-marked canker-blossom! Thou slanderous clay-brained fustilarian! Thou wayward rough-hewn malt-horse! Thou dankish motley-minded bear-whelp! Thou withered bat-fowling imbossed carbunkle!</p>
<p>You base football-player! You crooked-nose knave! You puterell, you skalemar. You hedge-born levereter, you bedswerver fopdoodle! Ye olde mucksprout and mumblecrust. You rakefile skobberlotcher. Thou subtle, perjur’d, false, disloyal man! Thou art like a toad; ugly and venomous. A most notable coward, an infinite and endless liar, an hourly promise breaker, the owner of no one good quality. Thou are pigeon-liver’d and lack gall. Thine face is not worth sunburning. You are as a candle, the better burnt out.</p>
<p>Thou spongy doghearted pigeon-egg! Thou adulterate decayed horse-drench! Thou base clapper-clawed boar-pig! Thou soulless tallow-faced clack-dish! Thou dissembling fool-born eternal devil! Thou gleeking fly-bitten bum-bailey! Thou jarring ill-bred no bowels! Thou creeping common-kissing malt-worm! Thou rank prick-eared coxcomb!</p>
