<h1>The Games</h1>
<p>
  It did not take long for games to be made following the guidelines presented in the movies and books. Game developers adapted much of the rules and regulations from the stories, from locations that would instantly trigger the explosives around the students’ necks, to the random assortment of weapons and items gained by contestants in the Hunger Games.</p>
  <p>
  The first major game to take these ideas and implement them was the Minecraft server gamemode Survival Games, sometimes called the Minecraft Hunger Games. This gamemode took the circular start and cornucopia of items from The Hunger Games books and movies. In possibly the best custom Minecraft experience ever, players must
  focus on finding items scattered around the map, rather than doing typical Minecraft stuff, like building houses or digging. Just like in the movies it is based on, alliances can be formed between groups of players to assist in hunting down stragglers. However, betrayal is highly likely, and you should always keep an eye on your fellow players.</p>
  <p>
  About two years later, the first game with firearms was developed, called The Battle Royale Mod for ArmA 3. Developed by an Irish man by the name of Brendan Greene, who goes by the name PlayerUnknown, the game was much faster paced and more violent than its blocky predecessor. This game garnered popularity from multiple sources, including Sony Online Entertainment, at the time known as Daybreak Games.</p>
  <p>
  Daybreak Games wanted to emulate the success of the ArmA 3 Battle Royale Mod with their own game, H1Z1. Brendan Greene was brought on as a consultant by the Daybreak Games team to recreate the success he had with his mod in a fully funded triple A game. The result was H1Z1: King of the Kill. This new game was a big success in its own right. Its success solidified the battle royale concept as an FPS subgenre in its own right. The game continues to get updates today, including a new always in vehicles mode called Autoroyale, but Brendan Greene wanted to do something better.</p>
  <p>
  After the success of his previous projects, Korean developer Bluehole recruited Brendan Greene to be a creative director for their newest project, PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds. This was a 100 person free-for-all, last man standing arena game, heavily reminiscent of Battle Royale and the other media that came between. The game
  featured an expansive map, totaling around 64 square kilometers in area and allowed for players to engage extensively in both close range and long range combat. PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds came to Steam Early Access in March 2017. As the first purpose built game of its kind, the game quickly built up one of the largest player bases on Steam, and set records for highest consecutive player count on the platform.
  When the game finally made it to full release, as well as other platforms, the game continued its early success, although not nearly as record setting.</p>
  <p>
  PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds was built using the Unreal Engine development kit created by Epic Games. Yes, THAT Epic Games. The development team of PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds used Epic Games’ feature request system for certain features required by the inherent nature of the game. Epic Games used these
  requested features for 100 player lobbies and scoring in the development of the ultra popular Fortnite, which Bluehole wasn’t very happy about.[6] </p>
  <p>
  Fortnite would be unaffected by controversy around its creation and go on to be even more popular than its predecessors. Its popularity would go uncontested for some time, and the game would appear as a popular culture reference in multiple tv shows and movies. But some people still don’t believe in its origins in a Japanese movie from back in 2000.
