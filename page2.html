<p>Thou art some fool, I am loath to beat thee. Thou reeky rampallian dewberry! Methink'st thou art a general offence and every man should beat thee. Were I like thee I'd throw away myself. Thou slander of thy heavy mother's womb! Thou fusty rude-growing flirt-gill! Thou misbegotten bat-fowling maggot-pie! Thine sole name blisters our tongues. Thou churlish shard-borne harpy!</p>
<p>Come, come, you talk greasily; your lips grow foul. Hast thou never an eye in thy head? Thou clouted crook-pated hugger-mugger! Thou dissembling idle-headed pigeon-egg! Thou mangled fen-sucked bum-bailey! Thou leathern-jerkin, crystal-button, knot-pated, agatering, puke-stocking, caddis-garter, smooth-tongue, Spanish pouch! Thou rank hedge-born boar-pig! Thou wimpled clapper-clawed flax-wench! Thou qualling unwash'd devil-mon!</p>
<p>There’s no more faith in thee than a stewed prune. Thou art a boil, a plague sore, an embossed carbunkle in my corrupted blood. Away you three inch fool! Thou art a natural coward without instinct. You, minion, are too saucy. Thou art the best of cutthroats. A weasel has not such a spleen as you are toss’d with. Your virginity breeds mites, much like a cheese. Thou leathern-jerkin, crystal button, knot-pated, agatering, puke-stocking, caddis-garter, smooth tongue, Spanish pouch. Thou art the son and heir of a mongrel bitch.</p>
