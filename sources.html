<p>There’s no more faith in thee than a stewed prune. Thou art a boil, a plague sore, an embossed carbunkle in my corrupted blood. Away you three inch fool! Thou art a natural coward without instinct. You, minion, are too saucy. Thou art the best of cutthroats. A weasel has not such a spleen as you are toss’d with. Your virginity breeds mites, much like a cheese. Thou leathern-jerkin, crystal button, knot-pated, agatering, puke-stocking, caddis-garter, smooth tongue, Spanish pouch. Thou art the son and heir of a mongrel bitch.</p>
<p>You base football-player! You crooked-nose knave! You puterell, you skalemar. You hedge-born levereter, you bedswerver fopdoodle! Ye olde mucksprout and mumblecrust. You rakefile skobberlotcher. Thou subtle, perjur’d, false, disloyal man! Thou art like a toad; ugly and venomous. A most notable coward, an infinite and endless liar, an hourly promise breaker, the owner of no one good quality. Thou are pigeon-liver’d and lack gall. Thine face is not worth sunburning. You are as a candle, the better burnt out.</p>
<p>You speak unskilfully: or, if your knowledge be more, it is much darkened in your malice. Thou goatish plume-plucked miscreant!Thou elvish-mark'd, abortive, rooting hog! Thou'rt by no means valiant; For thou dost fear the soft and tender fork of a poor worm. Thou art a man of wax. Thou foul defacer of God's handiwork. I scorn you, scurvy companion. What, you poor, base, rascally, cheating, lack-linen mate! Away, you moldy rogue, away!</p>
